## My process

I started off by dropping the JPEG's into Figma to get some sizes and try to figure out every detail of the project.

After that I went through the process of cleaning up the HTML and wrapping the different sections in their accompanying tags. I separated the header and main content first then moved on to the smaller sections.

CSS was up next and I chose to go with a mobile-first approach. I went through and styled the container, moved to the card overall style then the individual components. After the mobile was taken care of I moved on to the desktop version. Since I built this mobile first about 90% of the work was done, so it was just changing some margins and sizes. Finally the hover effects for the buttons and we are done.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had quite a bit of fun with this project. I learned how to implement CSS Grid and Flexbox together. Along with that I got to play more with media queries and mobile-first workflow which I've been focusing on.

### Continued development

I definitely would like to learn more about Accessibility and SEO. I feel like that could help shape the code that I'm writing to flow better.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - I feel like this ones a given. The guides on Flexbox and CSS Grid are life savers at all times. This is typically my go to for anything CSS related.

- [MDN Docs - HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - I've been learning about Accessibility and these docs are amazing. Rather than using all divs like I did when I started out I've started trying to be more thoughtful with the tags I use and MDN is always up at the ready.
